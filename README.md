Usage
Running the Script

For a Single Video
python m1_youtube_transcriber_suppress_warnings.py --video "YOUTUBE_VIDEO_URL"
For a Playlist
python m1_youtube_transcriber_suppress_warnings.py --playlist "YOUTUBE_PLAYLIST_URL"
Replace YOUTUBE_VIDEO_URL or YOUTUBE_PLAYLIST_URL with the URL of the YouTube video or playlist you want to transcribe.

Output
Audio Files: Saved in the downloads/ directory as .wav files.
Transcripts: Saved in the downloads/ directory with _transcript.txt suffix for each video.
Example
python m1_youtube_transcriber_suppress_warnings.py --video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0"
Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, make sure:

All dependencies are installed in the virtual environment.
You are running the script in the virtual environment.
For other issues related to YouTube API or Whisper model warnings, this script suppresses most non-critical warnings for cleaner output.
